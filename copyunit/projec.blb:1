	Scott Halbert Projects  Oct-86 to Feb-87

	Oct-86->Dec-86

	Main project in this time was to design, integrate, and program
	a self contained unit to be installed in the China Data
	Management Center in Beijing, China, which quickly copies data
	cartridges from the China Digital Seismograph Network.  Cartridges
	can be copied onto other cartridges or can be copied onto 9-track
	magtape to be read by the Data Management Center software.
	Diagnostic data dumps can also be made on the console.

	January 87.

	Scott will be implementing a procedure for converting the seismic
	data cartridges from Dry Valleys Seismic Project in Antartica into
	China tape format to allow it to be processed by the ASL seismic
	network data processing software.

	Some initial development work may be under way to design a replacement
	for the systems controller board in the SRO seismic systems, which 
	have become nearly impossible to repair.

	February 87.

	Scott will be in China installing the Cartridge	Duplicator machine, 
	and will be assisting John Hoffman with software problems involved 
	in the main software used in the China Data Management Center.

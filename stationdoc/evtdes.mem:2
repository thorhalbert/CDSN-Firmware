                  and an Explanation of the Onset Data Printout





                 The purpose  of  this  section  is  to  describe  the

            parameters  that  may  be  input  to the event detector to

            change its performance.  These parameters are described in

            more  detail  in the USGS open file report 83-785 by James

            N.  Murdock and Charles  R.   Hutt.   They  are  described

            herewith  as parameters used to monitor the amplitude of a

            signal and as parameters used  to  monitor  the  frequency

            content of a signal.



               Parameters Used to Monitor the Amplitude of a Signal

             NOTE: All of these parameters are octal (base 8) numbers





            XTH1      Xth1 is an octal code that  defines  the  factor

                      (see  table 1) of "twosd." Twosd is a measure of

                      the seismic background noise that is  output  by

                      the  filter of each detector.  (The responses of

                      the  respective  filters  are   represented   in

                      figures  1  and  2.)  Xth1  is  used  is used to

                      calculate a threshold value:  th1, such that th1

                      =  xth1  x twosd.  As described in the Open File

                      Report (on page 14), An event will  be  declared

                      if  one amplitude value of the signal is greater

                      than th1 and  two  other  amplitude  values  are

                      greater  than  th2,  assuming  that  all  of the

                      amplitude values pass  the  tests  described  in

                      "Parameters   Used   to  Monitor  the  Frequency

                      Content of a Signal."



            XTH2      Xth2 defines threshold th2 in the same manner as

                      xth1  defines th1:  th1 = xth2 x twosd.  One way

                      a signal can be detected is described above.   A

                      signal  may  be detected in another way as well:

                      Assuming the frequency criteria have  been  met,

                      an  event  will be declared when "n_hits" values

                      are greater than th2.  In the Open File  Report,

                      n_hits  was fixed at the value 4 (page 14).  The

                      parameter n_hits is  now  tunable,  it  must  be

                      given  a  value  greater  than,  or  equal to, 4

                      decimal.



            XTH3      Xth3 defines threshold th3 in the same manner as

                      the  above  thresholds:  th3 = xth3 x twosd.  As

                      described in the Open File Report (page 15), th3

                      is  used  to  search  for the onset of a signal.

                      Typically th3 is set to 10 (octal).  For  proper

                      operation of the detector, xth1 > xth2 >= xth3.



            XTHX      Xthx similarly defines a  threshold,  thx,  such

                      that  thx  =  xthx x twosd.  Thx is used to keep

                      unusually large values from  being  included  in

                      the  computation  of  twosd:  Values larger that

                      thx are not used to compute the estimate of  the


                                                                          Page 2





                      amplitude  of  the  background noise, this keeps

                      spikes from raising the thresholds.   In  normal

                      operation, xthx should be set no smaller than 14

                      (octal).



                   Parameters Used to Monitor Frequency Content

            NOTE: These parameters are expressed in decimal (base 10)





                 It  is  important  to  remember  that  the   detector

            monitors  the  amplitudes  of  the  background  noise  and

            signals in much the same way as a seismologist might  view

            a  seismogram:  The detector analyses the amplitudes (that

            is, the peak to trough differences) of the digital seismic

            data.   In  other  words, in contrast to the typical power

            level detector, the analyses are  performed  in  the  time

            domain, rather than primarily in the frequency domain.



            FILHI     Filhi is used to ensure that the amplitudes of a

                      candidate  signal  are  not  too close together.

                      The units of filhi are in samples.  Filhi can be

                      used  to  help  reduce  the effect of spikes and

                      man-made (cultural) noises.  As  an  example  of

                      how filhi works, for filhi = 8, if two amplitude

                      values  (each  greater  than  th2)  are   closer

                      together  than  8  samples, the second amplitude

                      value will not  be  used  to  help  trigger  the

                      detector:   Filhi  will  cause  rejection of the

                      second amplitude value.



            FILLO     Fillo is used to ensure that the amplitudes of a

                      candidate  signal  are  not  too far apart.  The

                      units of fillo are in samples.  Fillo is used to

                      help  reduce  the  effect of earth noise.  As an

                      example of how fillo works, for fillo =  40,  if

                      two  sucessive  amplitude  values  (each greater

                      than th2) are farther apart than 40 samples, the

                      first  amplitude  value will not be used to help

                      trigger  the   detector:    Fillo   will   cause

                      rejection of the first amplitude value.  Indeed,

                      the beginning  of  the  time  window  (described

                      below)  will  be moved to the time of the second

                      amplitude value.



            IWIN      Iwin is another time window.  The units of  iwin

                      are in samples.  (Typically, a window is 4 to 10

                      seconds long.) When the  first  amplitude  of  a

                      candidate  signal exceeds th2, the window begins

                      at  the  time  of  this   amplitude.    If   the

                      subsequent  amplitudes  meet  the constraints of

                      filhi and fillo, a signal will be declared,  if,

                      in  the  window,  n_hits  amplitudes are greater

                      than th2, or if  three  amplitudes  are  greater

                      than  th2  with  one  of them being greater than

                      th1.

            N_HITS    N_hits are the number of peak to  trough  values

                      with  amplitudes greater than th2, but less than

                      th1, that are  required  to  trigger  an  event.

                      N_hits  must  be  equal  to,  or greater than, 4

                      decimal.

                Values Suggested for Input and some Suggestions on

                           Further Tuning the Detector





                 The  following  values  are   designed   to   provide

            detection  of  all P wave signals that are clearly visible

            on a seismogram display, yet  to  provide  for  few  false

            alarms in normal operation.





                                       SP       BB

                           iwin       160      200

                           xth1        20       77

                           xth2        15       17

                           xth3        10       10

                           xthx        15       30

                           n_hits       4        5





                 If the design goals are not met,  adjustment  of  the

            parameters may be required.  (The best proceedure might be

            to record continuously so that the parameters may  be  set

            off line.) To reduce false alarms, one should try raising,

            and testing the effect of a  new  setting,  the  following

            parameters:



                            1.  xth1

                            2.  xth2

                            3.  xthx

                            4.  filhi (to decrease effect of  cultural

                                noise)





                 If clear events are missed, this  likely  means  that

            they  are  not in-band to the detector (the P-wave signals

            might have periods that are longer than 2 seconds).   Here

            one  might  try  lowering  xth1, increasing fillo, and, if

            necessary, increasing iwin.  Again, the best way  to  tune

            the  detector  is  offline.   This  is  the  way tuning is

            usually done at ASL.

                     The Meanings of the Onset Values Output



                 The following gives  the  meaning  of  the  different

            fields  printed  on the console when an event is declared.

            Here is an example message:



            SP EVENT DETECTED

            SP c 00 11999 86 0128 19:48:05.78 00162048 00.25 009054



            SP        This denotes  what  seismometer  and  band  were

                      being  monitored  for  events.   For  the  China

                      System, only two channels  are  monitored  (both

                      for  the  Z  component):   SP  (from the Chinese

                      short period seismometers),  and  BB  (from  the

                      Swiss seismometers on the Broad Band output).



            c         Denotes the polarity of the first break  of  the

                      signal (a 'c' or 'd').



            00        The "look back" value which  signifies  how  far

                      the  detector  looked  back to find the onset of

                      the signal.  The number will be 00,  01,  or  02

                      amplitudes (see pg 15 of Open File Report).



            11999     The quality determination of the onset (pg 16 of

                      the   Open   File  Report).   An  example  of  a

                      well-determined onset might  be  00abc,  with  a

                      look  back of 00, where a, b, and c, are greater

                      than 2.  An example of a poorly determined onset

                      might  be  ab1cd,  with a look back of 01 or 02,

                      where a, b, are 1 or larger, and c and d are any

                      positive number within their range.



            86        The year part of the time when the onset  signal

                      was declared.



            0128      The day of the year (1  is  January  1)  of  the

                      onset.



            19:48:    The hour and minutes of the onset (GMT).



            05.78     Seconds (expressed to two decimal places) of the

                      actual onset wave.



            00168827  The maximum amplitude of the first  four  cycles

                      of the signal (measured in digital counts).



            00.25     The average period of the first 4 cycles of  the

                      signal (in seconds or 1/hz).



            009054    The value of "twosd" which is the  amplitude  of

                      the background.  This is the value that was used

                      to calculate the threshold values th1, th2, th3,

                      and thx for detecting the event and timing.

              Actually Setting the CDSN Seismograph with the Console





                 Whenever the CDSN machine  is  turned  on,  rebooted,

            starts  a  new tape, or when a event parameter is changed,

            the  console  will  print  all  of  the   event   detector

            parameters.  This way the Data Management Center will have

            copies of these parameters when the logs are turned in.



                 The machine automatically  comes  up  in  full  event

            detected  mode.   This  means that the signals from the SP

            and BB are not written to tape unless events are detected.

            This is the normal operating mode.



                 There are times during testing and tuning when it may

            be  necessary to make the machine record all data, and not

            to use the event  detector.   This  is  called  continuous

            recording  mode.   This  should  not be used except during

            special situations since the tape cartridges fill up in  a

            mere  50  hours causing a station to produce too much data

            which can easily overload the Data Management Center.  The

            continuous  mode  may be set individually for short period

            and broad band.  These are set in the following way:



                      [BBCONT;FF]       (turn on BB continuous)

                      [SPCONT;FF]       (turn on SP continuous)

                      [BBCONT;00]       (switch back to event mode)

                      [SPCONT;00]       (switch back to event mode)



            If this is set correctly the machine will respond:



                      xxCONT DATA-OK*************************



                 When in continuous mode, the event  detector  can  be

            run of left off.  This causes the event detector to simply

            print out  onset  messages,  but  does  not  determine  if

            records  should  be  put on tape.  In continuous mode, all

            records are written to tape.  To turn the  event  detector

            on or off type in:



                      [BBSPEC;FF]       (to turn the BB detector on)

                      [BBSPEC;00]       (turn the BB detector off)

                      [SPSPEC;FF]       (turn the SP detector on)

                      [SPSPEC;00]       (turn the SP detector off)



                 In all cases if the message  was  entered  correctly,

            the  DATA-OK  message  will  appear,  otherwise  an  ERROR

            message will appear and the command should be retyped.



                 There are a series of  commands  to  set  the  actual

            event parameters.  Data are entered in the base which they

            are supposed to  be  in.   When  a  value  is  sucessfully

            changed  (DATA-OK),  the event detector will print out all

            of the parameters for that detector.  Here is  an  example

            of how to set the defaults given earlier.

                      [SPFIHI;0008]       [BBFIHI;0004]

                      [SPFILO;0080]       [BBFILO;0040]

                      [SPIWIN;0160]       [BBIWIN;0200]

                      [SPXTH1;0020]       [BBXTH1;0077]

                      [SPXTH2;0015]       [BBXTH2;0017]

                      [SPXTH3;0010]       [BBXTH3;0010]

                      [SPXTHX;0015]       [BBXTHX;0030]

                      [SPNHIT;0004]       [BBNHIT;0005]



                 Type the commands in one at a time, and  pause  after

            typing  the final ']' until the DATA-OK message comes out,

            and the new event parameters have printed.



            NOTE:  When adjusting  parameters  in  the  field,  it  is

            advisable to only increase or decrease, by a small amount,

            one parameter at time.  Let the system  operate  for  some

            time to determine the effectiveness of the change.



            NOTE:  When the system is rebooted (for  any  reason),  it

            forgets  all  of the operator settings, and returns to its

            initialized defaults.  The  operators  must  re-enter  any

            changed parameters each time this happens.

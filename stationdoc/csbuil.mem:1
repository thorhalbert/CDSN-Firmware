            There are a few command files which are provided to  build

            the  task  processor  program.  There are only a few steps

            involved in the build process.



            The main disk contains all of the program sources and  the

            basic  programming  environment  is  marked  "China System

            Development." This disk is always in  drive  0  (the  left

            drive),  and  should  be booted when the system is brought

            up.



            To build the system, place the  disk  marked  "Whitesmiths

            Cusps"  into  the  right  drive (drive 1, DY1:).  Then the

            command file can be executed to actually build all  pieces

            of the CDSN system.  This is done by typing "IND CDSN<CR>"

            at the dot.  This will build all main  pieces,  link  them

            together, and set up the files to be burnt onto PROMs.



            The  machine  will  proceed  unaided  (unless  there   are

            programming  errors), until it is ready to make PROMs.  At

            this time, the 86/14 system uses two  PROMs  to  hold  the

            entire  system  and  its  data.   These  PROMs  should  be

            27128A-2 or equivalent.  The OTP (one  time  programmable)

            plastic versions of these should be used for PROMs sent to

            China as export restrictions do  not  allow  the  windowed

            PROMs  to be exported.  The plastic PROMs are functionally

            identical to the windowed programs except that they cannot

            be erased.



            The program will ask you if the PROM programmer  is  ready

            in  remote mode.  Make sure that the programmer is on, and

            hit the following keys on the DATA I/O programmer [SELECT]

            [F]  [B] [ENTER] [ENTER].  Also make sure that the printer

            port is directed to the programmer.  The type "YES" to the

            prompt  on the Emulogic.  The command file will then enter

            a dialog with you to guide you through the PROM process.



            When this is complete, you will be back to RT-11  (at  the

            dot),  and  may  continue  on  from there.  If you wish to

            clear off the work files made during  the  last  build  to

            give  you  enough room to program, type in "@CLEAN<CR>" at

            the dot.  This will clean off the system disk and  squeeze

            it.

The following generic functions may be used with Fortran, C, and Pascal

	function dchan=ondete(samrate,arraysiz,FLAGS)
		FLAGS can consist of:

			ONSET - Prints the onset information out
			PARAM - Prints the parameters when they change

		Create a detector to work on generic long type data arrays.

	subroutine offdet(dchan)

		Remove a detector and eliminate any memory it took up.

	function dchan=onpak(samrate,compon,station,element,OPTIONS,FLAGS)
		OPTIONS can consist of:

			RSTN = Rstn data format
			SROD = Sro data format
			WSSN = Wssn Upgrade data format
			SRO = Sro Packet Format
			CDSN = Cdsn data format

		Create a detector to work on different data formats and
		packet formats.  Note, leave component, element, and station
		zero if they do not apply to your data situation.
			Station allows multiple stations to be present
			 in the data stream, it will pick only data 
			 on that station to analyse.  If left zero it
			 will ignore the station and process all stations.
			Component allows multiple components per record 
			 (up/down,north/south,east/west), the number 
			 is the offset within the data record for the
			 data.  Subroutine will determine how the data
			 is supposed to be packed.  A zero component
			 will pick the first component, and if there is
			 only one, all data will be used.  If the packet
			 says is more than one component, you will only
			 get the first one.  If a component you want
			 never comes along in the data, the detector 
			 will never be run.
			Element allows multiple seismometers per component
		 	 to be differentiated.  A zero element will select
			 the first element, and if there is only one, it
			 will process all of the data.  If the packet says 
			 there is more than one element, you will only get
			 the first one.  If the element you want never 
			 comes along in the data, the detector will never
			 be run.

	subroutine setdpr(dchan,various parameters...)
		
		Set given detector parameters.

	subroutine getdpr(dchan,various parameters...)

		Return detector parameters.

	function bigtime=timec(year,day,hours,min,sec,msec)
		
		Convert time units to a combined time figure.

	subroutine timebk(bigtime,year,day,hours,min,sec,msec)

		Convert from combined time figure into units.

	subroutine andata(dchan,array,starttime)

		Analyse a generic array of data.

	subroutine anpack(arraypacket,dchan1,...,dchan6)

		Analyse a formatted data packet, will only use data
		which was first specified in the onpak() routine above
		if there are more than 6 different channels to be analysed,
		this routine can be used more than once with different 
		channels.  

	subroutine getres(dchan,event evaluations...)

		Get results of the event analysis.  This will tell
		if the channel was run, if the tape write flag is on,
		if there was an event, and what the event looked like.
		This is often polled after an anpack() call to see
		what happened.

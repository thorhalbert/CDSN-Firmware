.c;Parameters Used to Tune the Event Detector
.c;and an Explanation of the Onset Data Printout
.sk 1
.p 5,1,4
The purpose of this section is to describe the parameters that may be
input to the event detector to change its performance.  These
parameters are described in more detail in the USGS open file report
83-785 by James N. Murdock and Charles R. Hutt. 
They are
described herewith as parameters used to monitor the amplitude of a
signal and as parameters used to monitor the frequency content of a
signal.
.sk 1
.c;Parameters Used to Monitor the Amplitude of a Signal
.c;NOTE: All of these parameters are octal (base 8) numbers
.sk 1
.lm +10
.p -10,1,4
XTH1######Xth1 is an octal code that defines the factor (see table 1)
of "twosd." Twosd is a measure of the seismic background noise that is
output by the filter of each detector. (The responses of the
respective filters are represented in figures 1 and 2.) Xth1 is used
is used to calculate a threshold value: th1, such that th1 _= xth1 x
twosd. As described in the Open File Report (on page 14), An event
will be declared if one amplitude value of the signal is greater than
th1 and two other amplitude values are greater than th2, assuming that
all of the amplitude values pass the tests described in "Parameters
Used to Monitor the Frequency Content of a Signal."

XTH2######Xth2 defines threshold th2 in the same manner as xth1
defines th1: th1 _= xth2 x twosd.  One way a signal can be detected is
described above.  A signal may be detected in another way as well:
Assuming the frequency criteria have been met, an event will be
declared when "n__hits" values are greater than th2.  In the Open File
Report, n__hits was fixed at the value 4 (page 14).  The parameter
n__hits is now tunable, it must be given a value greater than, or equal
to, 4 decimal.

XTH3######Xth3 defines threshold th3 in the same manner as the above
thresholds: th3 _= xth3 x twosd.  As described in the Open File Report
(page 15), th3 is used to search for the onset of a signal. Typically
th3 is set to 10 (octal).  For proper operation of the detector, xth1
> xth2 >_= xth3.

XTHX######Xthx similarly defines a threshold, thx, such that thx _= xthx
x twosd.  Thx is used to keep unusually large values from being
included in the computation of twosd: Values larger that thx are not
used to compute the estimate of the amplitude of the background
noise, this keeps spikes from raising the thresholds.  In normal
operation, xthx should be set no smaller than 14 (octal).

.p 5,1,4
It is important to remember that the detector monitors the amplitudes
of the background noise and signals in much the same way as a
seismologist might view a seismogram: The detector analyses the
amplitudes (that is, the peak to trough differences) of the digital
seismic data.  In other words, in contrast to the typical power level
detector, the analyses are performed in the time domain, rather than
primarily in the frequency domain.
.lm +10
.p -10,1,4
FILHI#####Filhi is used to ensure that the amplitudes of a candidate
signal are not too close together.  The units of filhi are in samples.
Filhi can be used to help reduce the effect of spikes and man-made
(cultural) noises.  As an example of how filhi works, for filhi _= 8,
if two amplitude values (each greater than th2) are closer together
than 8 samples, the second amplitude value will not be used to help
trigger the detector:  Filhi will cause rejection of the second
amplitude value.

FILLO#####Fillo is used to ensure that the amplitudes of a candidate
signal are not too far apart.  The units of fillo are in samples.
Fillo is used to help reduce the effect of earth noise.  As an example
of how fillo works, for fillo _= 40, if two sucessive amplitude values
(each greater than th2) are farther apart than 40 samples, the first
amplitude value will not be used to help trigger the detector:  Fillo
will cause rejection of the first amplitude value.  Indeed, the
beginning of the time window (described below) will be moved to the
time of the second amplitude value.

IWIN######Iwin is another time window.  The units of iwin are in
samples.  (Typically, a window is 4 to 10 seconds long.)  When the
first amplitude of a candidate signal exceeds th2, the window begins
at the time of this amplitude.  If the subsequent amplitudes meet the
constraints of filhi and fillo, a signal will be declared, if, in the
window, n__hits amplitudes are greater than th2, or if three amplitudes
are greater than th2 with one of them being greater than th1.

N__HITS####N__hits are the number of peak to trough values with 
amplitudes greater than th2, but less than th1, that are required
to trigger an event.  N__hits must be
equal to, or greater than, 4 decimal.

provide for few false alarms in normal operation.

If the design goals are not met, adjustment of the parameters may be
required.  (The best proceedure might be to record continuously so
that the parameters may be set off line.)  To reduce false alarms,
one should try raising, and testing the effect of a new setting,  the
following parameters:
.lm +20

2.##xth2 

3.##xthx

4.##filhi (to decrease effect of cultural noise)

.lm -20
.P 5,1,4
If clear events are missed, this likely means that they are not
in-band to the detector (the P-wave signals might have periods that
are longer than 2 seconds).  Here one might try lowering xth1,
increasing fillo, and, if necessary, increasing iwin.  Again, the best
way to tune the detector is offline.  This is the way tuning is usually
done at ASL.
.pg
.c;The Meanings of the Onset Values Output 
.p 5,1,0
The following gives the meaning of the different fields printed on the
console when an event is declared.  Here is an example message:
.sk 1
.P 0,0,4
SP EVENT DETECTED

SP c 00 11999 86 0128 19:48:05.78 00162048 00.25 009054
.lm +10
.P -10,1,4
SP########This denotes what seismometer and band were being monitored
for events.  For the China System, only two channels are monitored
(both for the Z component): SP (from the Chinese short period
seismometers), and BB (from the Swiss seismometers on the Broad Band
output).

c#########Denotes the polarity of the first break of the signal (a 'c'
or 'd').

00########The "look back" value which signifies how far the detector
looked back to find the onset of the signal.  The number will be 00,
01, or 02 amplitudes (see pg 15 of Open File Report).

11999#####The quality determination of the onset (pg 16 of the Open
File Report).  An example of a well-determined onset might be 00abc,
with a look back of 00, where a, b, and c, are greater than 2.  An
example of a poorly determined onset might be ab1cd, with a look back
of 01 or 02, where a, b, are 1 or larger, and c and d are any positive
number within their range.

86########The year part of the time when the onset signal was
declared.

0128######The day of the year (1 is January 1) of the onset.

19:48:####The hour and minutes of the onset (GMT).

05.78#####Seconds (expressed to two decimal places) of the actual onset wave.

00168827##The maximum amplitude of the first four cycles of the signal
(measured in digital counts).

00.25#####The average period of the first 4 cycles of the signal (in
seconds or 1/hz).

009054####The value of "twosd" which is the amplitude of the
background. This is the value that was used to
calculate the threshold values th1, th2, th3, and thx for detecting
the event and timing.

.c;Actually Setting the CDSN Seismograph with the Console
.sk 1
.p 5,1,4
Whenever the CDSN machine is turned on, rebooted, starts a new tape,
or when a event parameter is changed, the console will print all of
the event detector parameters.  This way the Data Management Center
will have copies of these parameters when the logs are turned in.

The machine automatically comes up in full event detected mode.  This
means that the signals from the SP and BB are not written
to tape unless events are detected.  This is the normal operating
mode.

There are times during testing and tuning when it may be necessary to
make the machine record all data, and not to use the event detector.
This is called continuous recording mode.  This should not be used
except during special situations since the tape cartridges fill up in
a mere 50 hours causing a station to produce too much data which can
easily overload the Data Management Center.  The continuous mode may
be set individually for short period and broad band.  These are set in
the following way:
.LM +10
.SK 1
.p 0,0,4
[BBCONT;FF]	(turn on BB continuous)

[SPCONT;FF]	(turn on SP continuous)

[BBCONT;00]	(switch back to event mode)

[SPCONT;00]	(switch back to event mode)
.LM -10
.p 0,1,4
If this is set correctly the machine will respond:
.LM +10
.p 0,1,4
xxCONT DATA-OK*************************
.LM -10
.P 5,1,4
When in continuous mode, the event detector can be run of left off.
This causes the event detector to simply print out onset messages, but
does not determine if records should be put on tape.  In continuous
mode, all records are written to tape.  To turn the event detector on
or off type in:
.LM +10
.SK 1
.p 0,0,4
[BBSPEC;FF]	(to turn the BB detector on)

[BBSPEC;00]	(turn the BB detector off)

[SPSPEC;FF]	(turn the SP detector on)

[SPSPEC;00]	(turn the SP detector off)
.LM -10
.p 5,1,4
In all cases if the message was entered correctly, the DATA-OK message
will appear, otherwise an ERROR message will appear and the command
should be retyped.
.P
There are a series of commands to set the actual event parameters.
Data are entered in the base which they are supposed to be
in.  When a value is sucessfully changed (DATA-OK), the event detector
will print out all of the parameters for that detector.  Here is an
example of how to set the defaults given earlier.
.LM +10
.SK 1
.P 0,0,4
[SPFIHI;0008]#######[BBFIHI;0004]

[SPNHIT;0004]#######[BBNHIT;0005]
.LM -10
.P 5,1,4
Type the commands in one at a time, and pause after typing the final
'_]' until the DATA-OK message comes out, and the new event parameters
have printed.
.P 0,1,4
NOTE: When adjusting parameters in the field, it is advisable to only
increase or decrease, by a small amount,  one parameter at time.
Let the system operate for some time to determine the effectiveness
of the change.
.p
NOTE: When the system is rebooted (for any reason), it forgets
all of the operator settings, and returns to its initialized defaults.
The operators must re-enter any changed parameters each time this happens.

The following preprocessor variables affect the configuration of the event
detector:
.LM +10
.P -5,1,5
UNIX - Is the system a UNIX system?
.P -5,0,5
Alternative:  The system is an RT-11 Whitesmiths C system.
.P -5,1,5
MAINDEF - Define the main section and variables?
.P -5,0,5
Alternative: Do not define the main subroutine.  The event detector is
configured to be a subroutine library to be called from the user's program.
.P -5,1,5
TIMESTAMP - Print the time out on STDOUT when minutes are 0?
.P -5,0,5
Alternative: Do not print the time out.
.P -5,1,5
PONSET - Print the onset information on STDOUT when event detected.
.P -5,0,5
Alternative: Do not print onset information out.  This information is still
returned by e_detect.
.P -5,1,5
LONGOUT - Use the extended event-detector tape handler?
.P -5,0,5
Alternative:  Do not use the extended tape handler.
.P -5,1,5
SRO - Use the SRO standard data packet format?
.P -5,0,5
RSTN - Use the CDSN/RSTN standard data packet format?
.P
Default: RSTN
.LM -5
.P 0,1,5
The following preprocessor variables are used during program debugging and
are not used during production:
.LM +5
.P -5,1,5
COMMENT - Never to be defined.  Used for extended comments or to
temporarily remove code.  Code should not be left this way, and should be
reinstated or permanently removed after debugging is completed.
.P 
DEBUG - Input code to print debugging information.
.P
LIMIT - Set to a numeric value which will determine the number of data
packets which will be read in the main program before it terminates:
.P -5,0,5
Alternative: Run until the end of the first tape.
.P -5,1,5
YEAR1D - A macro which will yield the 10's place of the year.  Used to
disable the 10's place if the hardware or software doesn't support 10's
place in the year.

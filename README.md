# CDSN-Firmware
China Digital Seismic Network (CDSN) Station Firmware

This software was developed by me for the Albuqerque Seismological Laboratory (part of the USGS) from 1985 to about 1987.

This was developed on an RT-11 workstation and cross-compiled for the 8088 in C and burned onto e-prom.   There were 10 of these stations installed in China.

These were later replaced by GSN stations.

I also designed a separate unit which could read the 3M QIC cartridges that these systems made and converted them to 1600 BPI 9-Track Magtape.   This included me desiging the hardware for a basic Pertic-Interface.
